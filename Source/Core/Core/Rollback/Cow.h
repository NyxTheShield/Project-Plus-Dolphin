// Rollback snapshots of guest RAM (MEM1 and MEM2) that copy only what changed.
//
// Writes are tracked by the dirty page bitmap (DirtyBitmap.h). The tracker keeps a mirror of RAM as
// it was at the newest snapshot. A snapshot copies the pages the bitmap marks, and only those whose
// bytes really differ from the mirror, into the newest undo log before the new snapshot opens.
// Restores and checksums are rebuilt from the mirror and the logs.
//
// Invariant: a page that is not marked dirty has the same bytes live as in the mirror. Every guest
// RAM write must therefore set the bitmap: JIT stores do it inline, and the other writers go through
// MemoryManager pointer accessors (GetPointerForRange) or call MarkPhysicalRangeDirty.
//
// Threading: the CPU thread drives this, and the bitmap can be set from other threads, so all
// tracker state is behind a lock. One snapshot ring owns the tracker at a time.
